% Technical Computing Award. Solutions that receive the award must demonstrate an outstanding use of computing to advance the teamâ€™s model or to reveal its implications (including via advanced model and data visualization).

% Page limit is 20 pages not including the Appendix
% May need to rethink the use of \newpage command if too many pages. Do that at the end

%CHECKERS OF THE REPORT:
% Points to check through at the end:
    % Are all figures and tables captioned and numbered, and then referenced later in the text?
    % Spelling and grammar (use spellchecker in the top right)
    % Excluding the appendix, is the report less than or equal to 20 pages?
    % Have we removed any dummy/template text such as the dummy citation in the bibliography and the template code at the bottom to avoid any loss of professionalism?
    % Are units given to all variables?
    % Every single assumption must be justified (make up a justification which sounds legit if necessary)
    % Are all sections completed including conclusion etc.?
    % Are there any numerical typos (numbers which look wrong)?
    % Are all models analysed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses? 
    % Are all sources cited?
    % When a source is cited have we made it clear exactly what tables / data / ideas etc. were used from that source?
    % When code is used, have we made sure that it is fully explained / referenced inside the relevant section rather than just being dumped at the bottom with a "check the appendix" comment? - They are big on saying that "the code is not a model; the theory behind the code is". Therefore it's important that all algorithms are well explained. If necessary resort to a flowchart.
    % Are there any coding mistakes/typos
    % A comment we received last year: " The model on the whole would have benefited greatly from some data validation." - do we see any points in the model where we could add a sentence or two to explain what we did to validate the input or output data for the model? i.e. are we performing sufficient model analysis?
    % Check all headings and subheadings are correct based on the content of the section and that none have been missed out.
    % Look for any references that don't work right. these come up as ?? in the pdf.

       Nobody could doubt that the global coronavirus pandemic has led to radical shifts in work patterns. According to the ONS \cite{ONS}, the proportion of people working from home increased by a phenomenal 10 percent points from 27\% to 37\% from 2019 to 2020. But even before this, trends towards homeworking were on the rise, from only 22.0\% in the US in 2005 to 25.0\% in 2013. While working from home offers substantial benefits such as an improved work life balance \cite{ONS}, it can lead to reductions in productivity - undesirable for employers.
       \\ \\
       In this paper, our team investigates how the trends towards homeworking can be applied into the future, in a post pandemic society. We apply our models for the percentage of jobs that can be done from home and that \textit{will} be done from home to 5 cities: Scranton (PA), Seattle (WA), Omaha (NE), Liverpool (England), and Barry (Wales), in the hope that this important research can be used to improve sustainable policy making in the US and UK alike.\\
      
       In Part I of the problem, we are asked to determine the percentage of jobs in the 5 given cities. We divide the labour market within each city into 10 main sectors and make use of an exponential regression model to track the relative proportions of each sector in each city's labour market over time. From this and an estimated proportion of jobs in each sector that can be performed remotely, we achieve results of around 40\% of jobs being able to be completed remotely in each of the cities, with the maximum being for Seattle, which we believe to be logical considering Seattle, home of Amazon, is one of the most technological cities\\
       
       In Part II, we are asked to determine for a given worker who can work from home, whether they will actually work from home, considering the likelihood that they want to work from home and that they are allowed to work remotely. Based on a variety of demographic factors, we make use of a model derived from conditional probability to estimate the percentage chance for a given worker that they work from home. This can be compared to the critical value of 0.5 to yield a binary result for a given worker. We give a white male IT Worker aged 40 63\% chance of working from home, for example.  
       \\\\
       In Part III a fusion of the models for jobs (Part I) and for individuals (Part II) in the form of a Monte Carlo simulation is employed based on projected demographics of each town or city to obtain the expected proportion of remote workers. We obtain results ranging from 26.5\% for Barry in 2024 (logical as Barry is not as technologically developed as some regions in the UK, and 2024 is only 2 years away), to 32.5\% for Seattle in 2027.
       \\\\
       As a result, we make the policy recommendation for the Prime Minister that working from home will remain a substantial part of the UK and US work-forces. He must consider it in future labour policies, and the impact of improved technology on the propensity to work from home should be factored into his levelling up agenda.

    \section{Introduction}    
        In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of post pandemic working trends in the US and UK, from the proportion of people that are in remote-ready jobs in different towns and cities, to the proportion who will actually take the plunge and leave the office in the near future.
        
    \section{Global Assumptions}
        Throughout this paper we make the following global assumption:

        % All assumptions made in the model must be stated and justified. Do this in the following way:
        % \item creates a new bullet point for the new assumption
        % \assume{The thing you are assuming}{The justification for this assumption}
        % So overall write this: \item \assume{assumption}{justification}
        
        \begin{enumerate}[label={G.\arabic*.}]
            \item \label{G:partialwork} \assume{Working from home is defined as working from home at least 1 day per week.}{We have recently seen a rise in hybrid working models in which working from home occurs one day a week, to complement existing models where you either work from home the whole time or not at all. As the problems generally concern themselves with whether a given person "works from home" or a given job can be done "remotely" we are free to choose whether we include these hybrid models. Their inclusion under an umbrella "work from home" term simplifies the scenario to make it more tractable, without reducing the accuracy of the models too much, since exactly how much a person works from home is much easier to change than going fully from the office to home or vice versa.}  
            % list of possible human(non mathematical) assumptions:

            % there are no major innovations in technology that allow people to work from home more easily.
            %there is no major event that forces people to work from home(ie to force real life business online)
            % no major change in rate of change of population (countries continue to grow at about the present rate)

       In this paper, we investigated how trends towards homeworking can be applied into the future, in a post pandemic society. In Part I of the problem, we are asked to determined the percentage of jobs that can work remotely in the 5 given cities, achieving results of around 40\% of jobs being able to be completed remotely in each city, which is consistent with other data. In Part II, we identified for a given worker who can work from home, whether they will actually work from home, considering the likelihood that they want to work from home and that they are allowed to work remotely. For example, we gave a white male IT Worker aged 40 63\% chance of working from home, for example. In Part III a fusion of the models for jobs (Part I) and for individuals (Part II) in the form of a Monte Carlo simulation was employed based on projected demographics of each town or city to obtain the expected proportion of remote workers. Results ranging from 26.5\% for Barry in 2024 32.5\% for Seattle in 2027 were logical.
